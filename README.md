## UFF Petrobowl Dashboard

A WebApp to manage games and inform performance from two teams.

## How-to
Just select the team, run the clock and wait for it to run out. If what runs out first is your patience, you can always click "Reset" and restart the clock. Each right question is worth +10 points, each wrong one is worth -05.

Good luck!

## Purpose

We, the Petrobowl Team of Universidade Federal Fluminense had no better way to manage game-time and scores from our participants, so decided it was time to invest a little bit of our time into a tool that could be useful for our day-to-day training, and also help other Petrobowl teams around the world.

Namely @DuckRodgers and @higortss (in alphabetic order).

## Current Phase

This is still Phase 1 of the project. Only a gameclock, score and player's name.

## Planned Improvements

Phase 2: Dashboard to check performance and online room with a buzzer to mark the players.
